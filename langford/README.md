A Langford sequence, is a permutation of the sequence of 2n numbers 1, 1, 2,
2, ..., n, n in which the two ones are one unit apart, the two twos are two
units apart, and more generally the two copies of each number k are k units
apart. Langford pairings are named after C. Dudley Langford, who posed the
problem of constructing them in 1958.
